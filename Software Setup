Install the required software packages, such as CUDA and cuDNN, to enable GPU acceleration for deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. You can use the following commands to install these packages:

```
sudo apt-get install cuda
sudo apt-get install libcudnn8-dev
```

## Define the Model

Define the architecture of the AI model that you want to train. This can be a pre-existing model or a custom model that you design based on your specific requirements. You can use frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch to define the model.

## Distribute the Workload

Use a distributed training framework, such as Horovod or TensorFlow distributed, to distribute the workload across the connected GPUs. This framework allows you to divide the model into smaller parts and train them in parallel on different GPUs. 

Here is an example of how to use Horovod for distributed training:

```
import horovod.tensorflow.keras as hvd

# Initialize Horovod
hvd.init()

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([...])

# Wrap the optimizer with Horovod
optimizer = hvd.DistributedOptimizer(tf.keras.optimizers.Adam())

# Compile the model with the Horovod optimizer
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer=optimizer)

# Train the model using Horovod
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32 * hvd.size())
```

## Monitor and Optimize Performance

Monitor the performance of the training process using tools such as TensorBoard or NVIDIA System Management Interface (nvidia-smi). Use this information to optimize the performance of the training process by adjusting parameters such as the learning rate and batch size.

For example, you can use TensorBoard to visualize the training progress and performance metrics:

```
# Start TensorBoard
tensorboard --logdir=path/to/log-directory

# Open TensorBoard in your browser
http://localhost:6006/
```

## Conclusion

By using multiple GPUs to train AI models, you can significantly speed up the training process and reduce the time it takes to develop and deploy machine learning models. This project provides a basic overview of how to cluster GPUs and distribute the workload for training deep learning models using frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
