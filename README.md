# Clustering-GPUs-for-training-AI-model-
Clustering GPUs for training AI models refers to the process of connecting multiple GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) together to increase the computational power and speed up the training process of AI models. This is achieved by distributing the workload among the connected GPUs, enabling them to work in parallel to train the model.
